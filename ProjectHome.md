Parallel magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) algorithms are important for numerical modelling of highly inhomogeneous solar and astrophysical plasmas. SMAUG is  the Sheffield Magnetohydrodynamics Algorithm Using GPUs. SMAUG is a 1-3D MHD code capable of modelling magnetised and gravitationally stratified magnetised plasma.

The methods employed have been justied by performance benchmarks and validation results demonstrating that the code successfully simulates the physics for a range of test scenarios including a full 3D realistic model of wave propagation in the magnetised and
stratified solar atmosphere.

SMAUG is based on the Sheffield Advanced Code (SAC), which is a novel fully non-linear MHD code, designed for simulations of linear and non-linear wave propagation in gravitationally strongly stratified magnetised plasma.
